# Self-Organizing Maps, Reinforcement Learning, and Particle Swarm Optimization  

## Overview  
This repository contains implementations of **Self-Organizing Maps (SOM)**, **Reinforcement Learning (RL)**, and **Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO)** for various computational tasks. The objective of this assignment is to provide hands-on experience with these techniques, allowing students to explore:  

- **Data visualization using Self-Organizing Maps**  
- **Agent navigation in a grid-world using Reinforcement Learning**  
- **Non-convex function optimization using Particle Swarm Optimization**  

## Features  
- Implementations of SOM for clustering and visualization  
- Grid-world environment for reinforcement learning experiments  
- PSO for solving complex optimization problems  
- Well-documented code and explanations  

The repository includes code, experiments, and documentation to facilitate understanding and experimentation with these machine learning and optimization techniques.
